    <h2>L&amp;D Web Developer</h2>

    <p>
      While at Macy's, my time has been spent working on internal sites with help from our
      UX/UI Developer in order to provide the right solutions to our Business Units' needs.
      During this time, I've been constantly expanding my knowledge around the many tools
      and technologies which make Web Development easier and faster (e.g. Bootstrap, NodeJS,
      LESS/SASS, etc.).

    <h2>Service Technician</h2>
    <h3>October 2016 - June 2017</h3>
    <h4>Portsmouth, Ohio</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>
      During my time with the WiFi Solutions Group, I worked a few jobs. I started as
      an assistant to the Intern who worked on Shawnee State University's campus. While
      in this role, I mostly helped the Intern with whatever job needed to be completed
      that day. Most of these jobs were completing resident calls in Student Housing.
      When I became a Service Technician, this workflow continued with the addition of
      giving a helping hand to one of the Senior Partners in various locations around Ohio.
      These jobs were typically more advanced such as: setting up wireless access points on
      development sites, running CAT5 cabling through buildings, and replacing outdated or broken
      technology such as bridges and gateways.

    <h2>Web Development Internship</h2>
    <h3>November 2016 - June 2017</h3>
    <h4>Portsmouth, Ohio</h4>
    <br/>
    <p>
      My time spent here was as a student worker for the Communications Department,
      where I mostly maintained the school's website, to be within the ADA Standards,
      as other departments and staff requested updates to their respective pages.
      There were, however, a few moments where I could apply custom JavaScript alongside
      HTML &amp; CSS in order to spruce up the appearance of certain pages.
