      I'm someone who loves to learn about technology. As a child,
      I was always very interested in how things worked, which often
      lead to the disassembling of whatever I was curious about. Be it
      the home computer, my clock, or the radio, you can almost guarantee
      that it's been in pieces at one point. This curiosity coupled with
      my interest in video games eventually lead me to one of my current
      hobbies, collecting and refurbishing old games and consoles.

      Like most of the younger generation, I often find myself in need of
      being continuously challenged. I would say this is more of a gift than
      a curse though, since it enables me to thrive in this day and age with
      the ever changing environment of technology. However, thanks to my
      current position at Teespring, I've had the fortune for my needs to be
      met in more ways than I could have imagined.
